These species include one human parasite, one parasite of veterinary relevance and two species from rodents, used as laboratory models. We now want to better understand this within-genus diversity, by also looking at the genome diversity with one species, specifically S. ratti. There are different isogenic lines of S. ratti available. (These other lines are recently wild, whereas the S. ratti line sequenced so far has a very long history of laboratory adaptation.) Further, phenotypic data from these lines show that they differ in important infection characteristics.  These isofemale lines of S. ratti differ in their fecundity (which, for a parasite is key to transmission potential), particularly in the presence of the host immune response (which, in general suppresses nematode reproduction). These line also differ in the extent to which they reproduce by sexual reproduction outside of the host (compared with the alternative, asexual reproduction). Analogously, this trait (sex vs. no sex) is also affected by the host immune response. Together, this means that these S. ratti lines differ in how they respond to the host immune response, which emphasies that this parasite's interaction with their host is dynamic both on short (i.e. within a worms lifetime) and long (i.e. evolutionary) term time scales. Exploring the genome diversity within this species will therefore begin to illuminate our understanding of these phenotypic differences.","taxonomyId":[34506],"speciesCommonName":"Rat threadworm","speciesScientificName":"Strongyloides ratti","sourceType":"Germline","center":"SC","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"S_ratti_ED321","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"http://parasite.wormbase.org/","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":10,"typeName":"Control Set"},{"name":"Diversity of Taiwan rice varieties","id":"PRJEB12769","description":"To study breeding and domestication trace of Taiwan","taxonomyId":[4530],"speciesCommonName":"Rice","speciesScientificName":"Oryza sativa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"IPMB, Academia Sinica","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"Build 4.0","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000, Illumina Genome Analyzer II","url":"http://ipmb.sinica.edu.tw/index.html/?language=en","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":5,"typeName":"Control Set"},{"name":"Genomic diversity and introgression in O. sativa reveal the impact of domestication and breeding on the rice genome","id":"PRJEB14385","description":"In this study, we utilize a novel 1,536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice.

Filters were applied to each of the Samtools and GATK produced VCF files to remove lower quality variants. These filters included remove variants with 2 or more alleles, remove variants never observed on forward or reverse strands, remove variants with overall quality less than phred score 20, remove variants with mapping quality less than phred score 30, remove variants with minimum depth less than 10 across all samples, remove variants with the same base pair position, remove lower quality indel when indels closer than 10 base pairs, remove lower quality variant where variants closer than 3 base pairs, remove SNP within 5bp of an indel. GATK CombineVariants was used to produce a union set of the filtered variants. An intersect set containing those variants concordant between Samtools and GATK predictions was extracted from this union set using GATK SelectVariants to produce the final VCF files.
